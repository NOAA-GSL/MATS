The files in this directory are exported from the mats.gsd.esrl.noaa.gov appProductionStatus mongo database automatically
each time a build modifies the data in the deployment collection. The utility that does the exporting can be found in the
mongo_utilities.source script in the scripts/common directory in this repository. The utility is named exportCollections.
The build script checks the files into the master and development branches of the git repository automatically.

If needed the data can be restored to the database using the mongoimport utility. https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongoimport/
