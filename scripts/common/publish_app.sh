# Used to copy all the existing meteor apps and part of .meteor to a production server

# This script should be modified in the following way...
# There should be a previous location on the target.
# the contents of the /web directory on the target server should be a link to a directory named after the publish date. i.e. 2016xxx where xxx is the julian day.
# initially this directory is a copy (cp -a) of the existing /web.
# there is a directory named previous that contains the contents of the website as it existed prior to the last update.
# 1. the current /web is rsynced (with delete) to the "previous"
# 1. the existing /web is archived to a new directory that is named after the publish date. i.e. 2016xxx where xxx is the julian day.
# 2. the new publication /web (from the dev server) is rsync'd to this new directory.
# 3. the /web link is re-established to the newly rsync'd directory.
# 4. the old directory is removed

# This is like a copy on write and minimizes the time that the web pages are in transition, thereby minimizing the chance that incomplete content might be accessed.
# It also gives us a backup copy of what was actually deployed previously.

This program will rsync the current /web directory to the production server named in the first parameter. It copies a selected list of apps that are found in
the appProductionStatus database and are returned by getPublishableApps, and then a slected subset of the /web/.meteor directory. This meteor stuff is neccessary for
the node part of phusion passenger.
