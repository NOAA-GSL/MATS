    <h2>The level and site matchers&nbsp;are used to match the data plotted on each axis agianst&nbsp;the other based on a percentage set by the user</h2>
    <p>When the level or site matcher&nbsp;is selected the data on both axes will be cut down to match the&nbsp;other as closely as desired. Due to inconsistencies&nbsp;collecting data from models and observations some data points may be skewed or misleading. However, only plotting&nbsp;data points that match exactly with every&nbsp;other&nbsp;point often leaves little or no data left to be plotted. The goal of the <em>axis matching quality</em> selector is to give the user control over the trade-off between the amount and the consistency of the data.</p>

    <p>If you are plotting wind speed on the x-axis and the y-axis for three different hours on a given day your data will look something like this:</p>
    <h1 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.9px 0.0px; line-height: 14.0px; font: 12.0px Times; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke-color: #000000;"><strong>x-axis</strong></h1>
    <p>8:00 - &nbsp; wind_speed [5.3, 7.6, 9.3, 15.4, 19.3] &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;at height [0, 20, 40, 60, 80]</p>
    <p>12:00 - wind_speed [3.2, 4.7, 6.8, 10.5, 14.2, 18.8, 21.3] &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; at height [0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120]</p>
    <p>4:00 - &nbsp; wind_speed [2.5, 6.4, 7.5, 9.9, 13.8] &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;at height [0, 20, 40, 60, 80]</p>
    <h1 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.9px 0.0px; line-height: 14.0px; font: 12.0px Times; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke-color: #000000;"><strong>y-axis</strong></h1>
    <p>8:00 - &nbsp; wind_speed [3.4, 6.7, 8.1, 13.2] &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; at height [0, 20, 40, 60]</p>
    <p>12:00 - wind_speed [2.2, 4.2, 7.9, 11.5, 15.8, 20.5] &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;at height [0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100]</p>
    <p>4:00 - &nbsp; wind_speed [2.5, 6.4] &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;at height [0, 20]</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Now you want to match the axes by level (height). When you plot a curve with the level axis matcher selected, three things happen:</p>
    <p>1. All the heights of both axis are unioned, in this case x-axis: [0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120] and &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; y-axis: [0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100]</p>
    <p>2. The intersection of the two is taken, in this example [0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100]. This is now your &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>common basis</strong> which all the data will be compared against.</p>
    <p>3. The <strong>common basis</strong> will be compared against every data point on both axes and the &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; percentage of values contained in both the point and the&nbsp;<strong>common basis</strong> will be calculated. The &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; first point on the x-axis contains 5 out of 6 of the values&nbsp;in the&nbsp;<strong>common basis</strong>&nbsp;so the percentage &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; returned will be 5/6 or 83%. The second point on the x-axis contains 6 out of 6 values and will &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return 100%. The last point on the y-axis contains 2 out 6 values and will return 33%.</p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; If the percentage returned is lower than the percentage set in the <em>axis matching quality</em> then the &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; point will be discarded and will not show up on the plot. If the <em>axis matching quality</em> is set to 0% all &nbsp; &nbsp; points will be plotted as if no matcher were selected, if set to 100% it is likely that little-to-no data &nbsp; &nbsp; will be plotted.</p>
