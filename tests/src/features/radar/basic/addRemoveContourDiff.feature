Feature: Add Remove ContourDiff

    As an unauthenticated user to the app,
    with the app in its default state,
    I want click the ContourDiff radio button,
    I want to add one curve.
    then plot that curve and see the graph,
    then go back to the curve management page,
    then delete that curve.

    Background:
        Given I load the app "/radar"
        Then I expect the app title to be "Radar"

    Scenario: addRemoveContourDiff
        When I set the plot type to "ContourDiff"
        Then the plot type should be "ContourDiff"
        When I change the "variable" parameter to "Composite Reflectivity"
        Then the "variable" parameter value matches "Composite Reflectivity"
        When I change the "data-source" parameter to "RAP_GSL"
        Then the "data-source" parameter value matches "RAP_GSL"
        When I set the dates to "09/21/2020 00:00 - 09/24/2020 00:00"
        Then the dates value is "09/21/2020 00:00 - 09/24/2020 00:00"

        Then "Curve0" is added

        When I change the "data-source" parameter to "HRRR_GSL"
        Then the "data-source" parameter value matches "HRRR_GSL"
        When I click the "Add Curve" button
        Then "Curve1" is added
        And I should see a list of curves containing "Curve0,Curve1"

        When I click the "Plot Unmatched" button
        Then I should be on the graph page
        And I should have a "Contour Diff" plot
