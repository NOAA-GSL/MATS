<div id="matshelp">
    <h1>Top</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Sets the maximum elevation (in meters) of the data that will be plotted. Works in conjunction with 'bottom' to set the altitude limits of the data being viewed. Setting to 0 will restrict the data to only surface measurements. Some variables and discriminators already restrict the data to surface level,&nbsp;so &#39;top&#39; will have no effect on these.</p>
