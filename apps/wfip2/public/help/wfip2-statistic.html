    <h1>Statistic</h1>
    <p>The statistic selector compares one data source to another and generates a plot based on the comparison.
        Once the desired statistic is selected another selector will appear named &#39;truth data source&#39;.
        For the sake of the statistic calculation the &#39;data source&#39; is considered the experimental value and the &#39;truth data source&#39;
        is considered the theoretical value.</p>
    <p>Note that the options/parameters for both &#39;data source&#39; and &#39;truth data source&#39; are the same.
        The &#39;truth data source&#39; is named solely for the purpose of statistic calculation&nbsp;and is not more accurate.</p>
    <p> Currently four statistical calculations are available.
        <ol>
            <li>mean: This is the default and is the only statistic that does not require a truth curve.</li>
            <li>bias: This is the sum of the differences between each qualified corresponding entry for the experiment and truth curves divided by the number of entries.</li>
            <li>rmse: </li>
            <li>mae:</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
