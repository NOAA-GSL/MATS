    <h1>Statistic</h1>
    <p>The statistic selector compares one data source to another and generates a plot based on the comparison.
        Once the desired statistic is selected another selector will appear named &#39;truth data source&#39;.
        For the sake of the statistic calculation the &#39;data source&#39; is considered the experimental value and the &#39;truth data source&#39;
        is considered the theoretical value.</p>
    <p>Note that the options/parameters for both &#39;data source&#39; and &#39;truth data source&#39; are the same.
        The &#39;truth data source&#39; is named solely for the purpose of statistic calculation&nbsp;and is not more accurate.</p>
    <p>"Mean" does not require a truth value and if you select "mean" as a statistical choice the "truth-data-source" selector is hidden.
    When you select one of the other statistics the "truth-data-source" selector is visible and the dependent selectors, which are "sites", "forecast-length", and "variable"
    have their options modified to reflect the valid possibilities that are jointly available to both the chosen "truth-data-source" and the chosen "data-source". If one of
    the dependent selectors has a current selection when you change from "mean" to another statistic, or from another statistic to "mean", or if you change the "datasource" or "truth-data-source"
    selection, and the dependent selection is available in the new common set of options, then that same selection will be automatically re-selected. If the previous selection
    is not available in the new common set of options then a default will be automatically selected.</p>
    <p> Currently four statistical calculations are available.
        <ol>
            <li>mean: 1/n ∑<sub>i=1..n</sub> (f<sub>(i)</sub>). This is the default and is the only statistic that does not require a truth curve.</li>
            <li>bias: 1/n ∑<sub>i=1..n</sub> (f<sub>(i)</sub> - f'<sub>(i)</sub>) This is the sum of the differences between each qualified corresponding entry for the experiment
        and truth curves divided by the number of entries.</li>
            <li>rmse: √ (∑<sub>i=1..n</sub>(f<sub>(i)</sub> - f'<sub>(i)</sub>)<sup>2</sup>)</li>
            <li>mae:1/n ∑<sub>i=1..n</sub> ⎮ (f<sub>(i)</sub> - f'<sub>(i)</sub>) ⎮</li>
        </ol>
