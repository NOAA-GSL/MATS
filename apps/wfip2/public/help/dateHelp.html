	<H1>Date Range Selector</H1>
	<P>The Date Range selector is used to bound the data plotted by
	time. You can specify a date and time in 15 minute intervals.&nbsp;</P>
	<P>The Date Range selector is activated by clicking on the control
	button (dark blue), or the value button (light blue). To hide the
	selector either click again on the control or value buttons anywhere
	or de-focus the selector by clicking somewhere else on the screen.
	The current selection is always visible in the value button (lighter
	blue button).</P>
	<P>There are three primary areas in the selector. 
	</P>
	<UL>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the left is a set of
		predefined ranges, 'Today', 'Yesterday', 'Last 30 Days' etc.
		Clicking one of these sets the Date Range start and stop
		appropriately and closes the selector. If a predefined range has
		been previously selected you may need to click on 'Custom Range' to
		un-hide the calendar/clock portion of the selector. 
		</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the middle of the selector is
		the start calendar. You activate the start calendar by clicking
		anywhere in it. When either the start or stop calendar is activated
		rolling the cursor over different days will cause the display box
		at the top to reflect the potential date that will be selected if
		you click on a day. Clicking on a day will select that day and
		automatically activate the stop calendar. 
		</P>
		<LI><P>On the right side is the stop calendar. It is automatically
		activated when you select a start day. The display box at the top
		right will display potential stop selections under the cursor.
		Watching the display box change is one way to know if the expected
		calendar is active. Selecting a stop date automatically
		re-activates the start calendar. Once the start and stop dates have
		both been selected you can apply the selection by clicking the
		'Apply' button under the predefined ranges. 
		</P>
	</UL>
	<P>Once a start and stop date have been chosen, you can use the hour
	and minute selectors to set a start and stop time. These selectors
	are independent. 
	</P>
	<P>The month and year can be set with the month and year number
	spinners for either start or stop, or you can roll both calendar
	earlier or later month by month by clicking the left and right
	arrows at the side of the month year selectors. 
	</P>
	<P>Clicking either the Apply or the cancel button will hide the Date
	Range Selector. Apply will apply the dates that are set in the
	calendars, cancel will leave the value button unchanged.</P>
	<H1>Date Range Interactions with data sources</H1>
	<P>The  Date Range selector interacts with the data source and truth
	data source selectors. When you choose a data source or a truth data
	source it has a date range for which data is available for that data
	source. Truth data is only necessary when you choose a statistic
	that requires a truth data source. If truth data is not required
	then only the actual data source will be interacting with the date
	range selector. Each time that you change a data source or a truth
	data source a specific sequence is analyzed to determine what date
	range is selected and subsequently displayed in the date range
	selector. The following image illustrates the interaction.</P>
