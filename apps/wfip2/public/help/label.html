    <h2>Labels</h2>
    <p>Labels are a means of identifying your curves.</p>
    <p>The labels are automatically generated, based on a common setting, to a prefix (default 'C') and a
    '-' followed by the curve number.
    </p>
    <p>You can modify a label by clicking on the label control and entering a new label in free form text.</p>
