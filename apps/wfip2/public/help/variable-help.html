    <p class="c1"><span>For certain models, additional variables will
    be listed in this drop down menu that match what are seen in the
    discriminator box below. These are two dimensional variables and
    cannot be verified against observations. Only raw data plots are
    available at the present time. See the discriminator help box for

    <p class="c1"><span>Discriminator Box:</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c2"></p>
    <p class="c1"><span>Discriminators are two dimensional variables
    derived from specific models and are used as a filtering option on
    the verification data produced by this interface. For example, the
    user can see a model&rsquo;s wind speed skill when the surface heat
    flux is inside specific bounds by setting upper and lower
    thresholds of the discriminator (in this case surface heat
    flux).</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c2"></p>
    <p class="c1"><span>Note: When a discriminator is selected, the
    upper and lower thresholds are set to the corresponding max and min
    values possible for that field by default, meaning no filtering
    will be done.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c2"></p>
    <p class="c1"><span>Currently 15 discriminators are
    available:</span></p>
