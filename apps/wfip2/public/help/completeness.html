    <h2>Completeness</h2>

    <p>Completeness is a way of making your dataset meet a certain completeness criteria, expressed as a percentage.</p>

    <p>The data for this tool is gathered in groups. For example,&nbsp;all of the wind speed data is&nbsp;grouped by level, bounded by a top and a bottom level&nbsp;for every individual&nbsp;site, and restricted to a certain time range. The value at a given point in time is statistically derived, defaulting to the mean. For example, if the statistic is &quot;none&quot; and the variable is &quot;wind speed&quot; then the values on the graph will be the mean of the wind speeds&nbsp;for every level&nbsp;within the top and bottom boundary&nbsp;for each time.</p>

    <h2>levels</h2>

    <p>It is possible that, at a certain&nbsp;time, one&nbsp;site might&nbsp;have only reported data for a subset of the levels which it is normally capable of. This is where completeness comes in handy. If you consider the maximum set of levels possible for the data set that you have selected as a &#39;basis set&#39; of levels&nbsp;then you can choose a percentage of completeness that must be met for each data point, derived by comparing&nbsp;each point against that basis,&nbsp;in order to have the data included into the mean.</p>

    <p>For example:&nbsp;there may be 10&nbsp;distinct&nbsp;levels between a bottom of 40 and a top of 200. If I ask for 20 sites, and one of those sites, at a given time, only has 5 levels reported, then that point&nbsp;is 50% complete. Had I specified a completeness of 60% the data routine would throw away that set of levels and not consider it into the mean calculation for that point. If I set a completeness of 100 then each site at every time must have the maximum possible number of levels reported. If I specify a&nbsp;completeness of 0 then all levels reported will be considered for each site into the mean calculation.</p>

    <p>For the data set below, a completeness of 100 would result in rows 3, 4, and 5 being discarded, while&nbsp;a completeness of 80 would result in the data for row 3 being discarded and the remainder retained for use in the calculation.</p>

    <h2>sites</h2>

    <p>Sometimes more than one site can be used to derive&nbsp;the data. Similarly to levels,&nbsp;if the&nbsp;total possible number of sites for the data set is&nbsp;10&nbsp;and a site completeness of 80 is specified, each data point that does not have at least 8 sites (80 percent of the total possible) reporting data will be discarded. A completeness of 0 would cause the data routine to use all of the sites.&nbsp;</p>
