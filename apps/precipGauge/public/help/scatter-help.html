        <h1>Scatter Plots</h1>
        <p>A scatter plot is the equivalent of two TimeSeries curves graphed against each other, one on the x-axis and one on the y-axis. To make a scatter plot simply select all the parameters of the first TimeSeries curve and click &#39;Apply to axis&#39; (make sure the correct axis is selected) and you should see the &#39;*AXIS NOT YET APPLIED&#39; text change to the curve text for the curve you just added.</p>
        <p>Do this for both axes and then click &#39;Add Curve&#39; at the bottom. You can add as many curves as you want, just make sure to double-check that you&#39;re always applying to the correct axis.</p>
