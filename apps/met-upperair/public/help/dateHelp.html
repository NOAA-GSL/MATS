    <h1>Date Range Selector</h1>
    <p>The Date Range selector is used to bound the data plotted by time. You can specify a date and time in 15 minute intervals.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The Date Range selector is activated by clicking on the control button (dark blue), or the value button (light blue). To hide the selector either click again
        on the control or value buttons anywhere or de-focus the selector by clicking somewhere else on the screen. The current selection is always visible
    in the value button (lighter blue button).</p>
    <p>There are three primary areas in the selector.
    <ul>
        <li>On the left is a set of predefined ranges, 'Today', 'Yesterday', 'Last 30 Days' etc. Clicking one of these sets the Date Range start and stop
        appropriately and closes the selector. If a predefined range has been previously selected you may need to click on 'Custom Range' to un-hide the
        calendar/clock portion of the selector.</li>
        <li>In the middle of the selector is the start calendar. You activate the start calendar by clicking anywhere in it. When either the start or stop
        calendar is activated rolling the cursor over different days will cause the display box at the top to reflect the potential date that will be selected if
        you click on a day. Clicking on a day will select that day and automatically activate the stop calendar.</li>
        <li> On the right side is the stop calendar. It is automatically activated when you select a start day. The display box at the top right will display potential
        stop selections under the cursor. Watching the display box change is one way to know if the expected calendar is active. Selecting a stop date automatically re-activates
        the start calendar. Once the start and stop dates have both been selected you can apply the selection by clicking the 'Apply' button under the predefined ranges.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once a start and stop date have been chosen, you can use the hour and minute selectors to set a start and stop time. These selectors are independent.
    </p>
    <p>The month and year can be set with the month and year number spinners for either start or stop, or you can roll both calendar earlier or later month by month by clicking
        the left and right arrows at the side of the month year selectors. </p>
    <p>Clicking either the Apply or the cancel button will hide the Date Range Selector. Apply will apply the dates that are set in the calendars, cancel will leave the value button
    unchanged.</p>
