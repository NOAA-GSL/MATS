Code coverage reporting is available if _instrumented_ code is detected.  Currently only _instrumentation_ via [node-jscoverage](https://github.com/visionmedia/node-jscoverage) is supported.  When _instrumented_ code is detected and coverage reporting is enabled using any of the `--cover-plain`, `--cover-html`, or `--cover-json` options a code coverage map is generated.
