    <h1>Statistic</h1>
    <p>The statistic selector compares one data source to another and generates a plot based on the comparison. Once the desired statistic is selected another selector will appear labelled &#39;truth data source&#39;. For the sake of the statistic caluclation the &#39;data source&#39; is considered the experimental value and the &#39;truth data source&#39; is considered the theoretical value.</p>
    <p>Note that the options for both &#39;data source&#39; and &#39;truth data source&#39; are the same. The &#39;truth data source&#39; is named solely for the purpose of statistic calculation&nbsp;and is not more accurate.</p>
