    <h3>scatter plots</h3>
    <p>
        A scatter plot requires a data set for each axis. One way to think of it is to visualize two time series curves with correlated time points, and then
        visualize the y components of the first curve on the x axis of the scatter plot, and the y component of the second curve on the y axis of the scatter plot.
        Each point of the scatter plot is a time correlated point derived from the y axis components of the corresponding x (time) points of the two curves.
    </p>
    <h3>axis selector</h3>
    <p>
        The axis selector is how you decide which set of curve parameters are being applied to which axis of the scatter plot. The radio buttons labeled "xaxis" and "yaxis" show to which
        axis the current set of parameters will be applied when the "apply to axis" button is pressed.
    </p>
    <h3>automatic axis change</h3>
    <p>
        When you press the "apply to axis" button the radio buttons should be automatically changed. The "Scatter 2d" page presents the "xais" selection when the page loads and as you
        use the "apply to axis" button the radio selections should change automatically.
    </p>
    <h3>status indicator</h3>
    <p>
        Once you have applied parameters to an axis the red "(X|Y)AXIS NOT YET APPLIED" indicator should change to a green status that reflects some of the curve parameters
        that you have applied to the axis.
