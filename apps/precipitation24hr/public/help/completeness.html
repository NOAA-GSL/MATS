    <h2>Completeness</h2>
    <p>Completeness is a way of making your dataset meet a certain completeness criteria, expressed in a percentage.</p>
    <p>The data for this tool is gathered in groups. For example all of the wind speed data, grouped by level,
        bounded by a top and a bottom level, for a certain site and bounded by a certain time range. The actual value at
        a given
        point in time is statistically derived, by default the mean is used. If the statistic is "none" and the variable
        is "wind speed" for example,
        the values will be the mean of the wind speed values for all the levels within the top and bottom boundary for
        the site.
    </p>
    <h2>levels</h2>
    <p>It is possible that, for a given time, a given site might only have reported data for a subset of the levels for
        which it is normally capable.
        This is where completeness comes in. If you consider the maximum set of levels possible for the data set that
        you have selected as a basis set of levels, then
        you can set a percentage of completeness that must be met for each data point against that basis in order to
        have the data included into the mean. For example,
        if I am looking at levels between 40 and 200 that might correlate to 9 distinct levels. If I ask for 20 sites,
        and one of those sites, at a given time, only has
        10 levels reported, then that point in time is 50% complete. Had I specified a completeness of 60% the data
        routine will throw away that set of levels and not consider it into
        the mean calculation for that point in time. If I set a completeness of 100 then each site at every point in
        time must have the maximum possible number of levels reported.
        If I specify a 0 completeness then all levels reported will be considered for each site into the mean
        calculation.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the data set below a completeness of 100 would result in rows 3, 4, and 5 being discarded, and a
        completeness of 80 would result in the data for row 3 being discarded and the rest
        retained for use in the calculation.

    <h2>sites</h2>
    <p>
        In certain plots more than one site can be used for deriving the data. In similar fashion if a total possible
        number of sites for the data set is, for example, 10,
        and a site completeness of 80 is specified, each reporting time that does not have at least 8 sites (80 percent
        of the total possible) reporting data will be discarded.
        A completeness of 0 would cause the data routine to use all of the sites. ...
