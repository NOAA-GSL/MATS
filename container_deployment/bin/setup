This program will help you configure your MATS tool suite environment based on one of the standard environments.
To do this you must have access to the internet.
This program will query the GSD appProduction service which deployment environments are currently
supported for assisted deployment. Then it will ask a series of questions in this order...
1) It will ask you which environment you wish to deploy. Choose an environment by number. The setup will ask the GSD server which versions
of the apps for your selected deployment are currently up to date.
2) The program will ask you to verify the domainName of your deployment server. It uses this to configure its own proxy service that fronts the apps.
3) It will prompt you for the fully qualified proxy hostName, defaulting to the domainName. If your public URL is the same as your domainName just accept the default. Your
deployment might be behind a redirection proxy with redirection to a different path than what is actually on the host - for example, at GSD our mats server might
be deployed on a server with an internal URL "https://something.subnet.esrl.noaa.gov" with the landing page location "/", while the public URL is a proxy redirect
"https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gsd/mats". In this case the fully qualified proxy hostName is www.esrl.noaa.gov and the proxy_prefix_path needs to be set to "/gsd/mats".
4) Next you will be prompted for a proxy redirection path. This allows you to serve a different path than "/".
5) Finally you will be prompted you for database credentials for each role required by each app.
Database roles are usually some combination of meta_data - the database that contains app metadata,
sums_data - the database that contains an apps statistical partial sum data, model_data - a database that
contains metadata about data sources, and possibly sites_data - which contains non standard domain data.
The credentials that you provide are stored in a ${DEPLOYDIR}/settings directory with the structure ${DEPLOYDIR}/settings/appreference/settings.json. This directory will NOT
be publicly accessible. If you are familiar with this directory and the settings.json files you can make changes with an editor and the setup program
will use the existing values as defaults.
The settings files also hold the proxy_prefix_path from 4).
The program configures this deployment directory, creating a ${DEPLOYDIR}/docker-compose.yml configuration file,
and a ${DEPLOYDIR}/traefik.toml file, a suitable ${DEPLOYDIR}/web/index.html as a homepage,  and utilities such as up, down and monitoring scripts in the
${DEPLOYDIR}/bin directory.
You must have docker, docker-compose and jq installed, and you must be running this script from ${DEPLOYDIR}.
You must be running this program as a user that can run docker - do not run this script as root, in fact do not run any containers as root.
After once configuring an app you will have to confirm overwriting the old configuration if you ever re-run setup.

The reverse proxy interface has a user/password pre-set to user "admin" and password "adminpassword", you should change this by following the instructions in the traefik.toml file.
This program will create a settings directory here in this directory and a mongodata directory in the $HOME of this user if they do not already exist.

There are two ways to handle ssl. You can let traefik use lets-encrypt automatically to generate and store certs.
These are requirements for traefik/lets-encrypt certs
1) You cannot have a firewall blocking outbound traffic  from your server and https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
2) You have to follow the comments in the traefik.toml file and properly comment out the externally acquired cert sections
and uncomment the traefik/lets-encrypt sections.
Specifically - comment out these lines...
[entryPoints.https.tls]
[[entryPoints.https.tls.certificates]]
certFile = "/etc/ssl/certs/${unqualifiedHostName}.crt"
keyFile = "/etc/ssl/certs/${unqualifiedHostName}.key"

and uncomment this line in the entrypoints.https section..
#[entryPoints.https.tls]

and uncomment these lines...
#[acme]
#  caServer = "https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory"
#  email = "mats.gsd@noaa.gov"
#  storage = "acme.json"
#  entryPoint = "https"
#  [acme.tlsChallenge]
#[[acme.domains]]
#  main = "${domain}"

If you want to use externally acquired certs then you need to acquire an SSL cert for your domain and put the certificate in /etc/ssl/certs directory of this host. If you have authority over the DNS entry for
your server you can use LetsEncrypt for no cost certs. The instructions for doing this are at https://docs.traefik.io/configuration/acme/.
If you cannot acquire a certificate you can enable the apps temporarily by commenting out
#        [[entryPoints.https.tls.certificates]]
#        certFile = "/etc/ssl/certs/mats-meteor.crt"
#        keyFile = "/etc/ssl/certs/mats-meteor.key"
in the traefik.toml file.
Follow the comments in the traefik.toml file to make sure you have commented or uncommented the appropriate sections.

The toolsuite entrypoints are 
https://yourfullyqualifieddomaini/proxy for the reverse proxy dashboard (look at comments in traefik.toml and docker-compose.yml to enable)
https://yourfullyqualifieddomain  for the top level landing page
https://yourfullyqualifieddomain/appref   for an individual app (replace appref with the actual app reference.)

After configuration you can start your toolsuite with.... 
${PWD}/bin/up
and you can stop your toolsuite with..
${PWD}/bin/down

you can rerun this setup with...
cd ${DEPLOYDIR}
bash bin/setup

You may want to occasionally rerun the setup to pick up bug fixes and newly released apps for your deployment. This URL
https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gsd/mats/appProductionStatus/versions shows the latest versions of the apps available for all the deployments.
By comparing those versions to the versions in your running apps you can determine if an update is necessary. You
can tell the version of a running app by looking at the comments in the docker-compose.yml file. This file is recreated when
you run the setup, with the current version for each app.
